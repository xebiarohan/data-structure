1. Linked lists are dynamic in length where as the for array list we have to provide an initial value (default is 10)
   
2. Items of linkedlist can be anywhere in the memory, items of lists are present next to each other 

3. Big O
    - Adding item at the end of the list : O(1)
    - Removing item at the end of the list: O(n)
    - Adding/Removing item at the beginning of the list: O(1)
    - Adding/Removing item from the middle: O(n)
    - Searching for a value: O(n)

4. Adding/Removing an item from beginning is bettern in linked list, where as removing last and looking by an index is better in arrays
